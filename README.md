# 🎮 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple but fun console-based number guessing game written in Python.  
The game supports **two modes**:

1. **Player guesses the computer's number**  
2. **Computer guesses the player's number**

This project is great for practicing:
- Python basics
- Loops & conditions
- Functions and clean code structure
- Algorithmic thinking (binary search)

### ✔ Mode 1 — Player Guesses
- The computer picks a secret number between **1 and 10**
- The player tries to guess it
- The game gives hints:
  - "My number is larger"
  - "My number is smaller"
- Shows the number of attempts at the end

### ✔ Mode 2 — Computer Guesses
- You think of a number between **1 and 10**
- The computer guesses intelligently using **binary search**
- You tell the computer:
